# Simple-arduino-ultrasonic-sensor
This project features an Arduino Uno, an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04), and a buzzer to measure distance and sound an alert when something gets too close. Think of it as a basic parking sensor. The ultrasonic sensor emits sound waves and tracks how long it takes for them to return. The Arduino then uses that time to figure out the distance. If the object is within 50 centimeters, the buzzer activates; if not, it stays silent.
